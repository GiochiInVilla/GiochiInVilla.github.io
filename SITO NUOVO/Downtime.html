    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Downtime Activities</h1>
    <p>
        The campaign benefits when characters have time between adventures to engage in other activities.
        Allowing days, weeks, or months to pass between adventures stretches the campaign over a longer period
        of time and helps to manage the characters' level progression, preventing them from gaining too much
        power too quickly.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Lifetimes Expenses</h2>
    <p>
        We can't talk about downtime without talking about lifestyle expenses. While some downtime activities allow
        you to circumvent this cost, if you don't plan on doing anything with your downtime, you will be required
        to pay this cost in order to afford lodging, food, and the maintaining of armor and weapons.

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Practicing a Profession</h2>
    <p>
        If you don't want to pay those pesky lifestyle expenses, you can go from action-packed
        adventuring to working a job. Practicing a profession allows you to live a modest lifestyle
        without paying the cost as long as you keep working.
        Finally, if your character is willing to put themselves out there and has a proficiency
        in performance, they can perform and maintain a wealthy lifestyle without paying the cost.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Building A Stronghold</h2>
    <p>
        So, you have recently come into a bit of land, whether it be through money or murder.
        You can now build a stronghold on it. Building a stronghold requires a lot of time and money
        and usually should be done after a large adventure. Basically, the bigger the building is,
        the more it cost and the longer it takes.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Carousing</h2>
    <p>
        A player spends enough money to maintain a wealthy lifestyle, or 400 Eres/Day, and at the end of the period, they roll on a table to see what happens.
        If you want to spend time with the upper class, you'll either need access to the local nobility or be disguised with one.
        During the week you mingle, party, and socialize with members of that social class.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>01-10</b><div style="font-size: 12px;">You are jailed for 1d4 days at the end of the downtime period
            on charges of disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. You can pay a fine of 10 gp to avoid jail time,
            or you can try to resist arrest.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>11-20</b><div style="font-size: 12px;">You regain consciousness in a strange place with no memory of how you
            got there, and you have been robbed of 3d6 x 250 Eres.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>21-40</b><div style="font-size: 12px;">You make an enemy. This person, business, or organization is now hostile to you.
            The DM determines the offended party. You decide how you offended them.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>41-50</b><div style="font-size: 12px;">You earn modest winnings from gambling and recuperate your lifestyle expenses
            for the time spent carousing.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>51-80</b><div style="font-size: 12px;">You find some allies and intel. They'll now help you. The DM determines the allies.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>81-100</b><div style="font-size: 12px;">You find some allies and intel and you make a small fortune gambling. You gain 3d6 x 500 Eres.
            Your carousing becomes the stuff of local legend.</div></li><br>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Crafting Magical Items</h2>
    <p>
        Crafting a magical item is a long and complicated process. First the crafter needs to be able to cast spells.
        You will need materials, unlike non-magical items, magical items require specific materials that could take whole adventures to gather.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Crime</h2>
    <p>
        You can spend your downtime planning and executing a heist. First, you spend 250 Eres and a workweek on intel.
        Then you make, a series of crime related checks, such as stealth for not getting caught and deception since
        you got caught. The amount of successful checks determines the outcome of the heist, ranging from being
        caught and jailed to making it out with a small fortune.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Gaining Renown</h2>
    <p>
        You can spend your downtime doing small task and socializing with members of a faction.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Performing Sacred Rights</h2>
    <p>
        If there is a temple near you that is affiliated with your god, you can spend your time performing sacred
        ceremonies such as weddings, funerals, and sacrifices. You will gain favor from your god or the church.
        These can either be favors you can ask the church, help with spellcasting costs, or divine interventions from the god themselves.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Pit Fighting</h2>
    <p>
        Pit fights consist of organized, competitive, non-lethal fights, though your DM can choose to make them lethal.
        Your DM can choose to enact each of these fights, creating a separate combat encounter for each one.
        Unlike committing crimes or gambling, you lose nothing if fail all your roles.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Recuperating</h2>
    <p>
        In order to relax, you must be able to maintain a modest lifestyle while you recuperate.
        You gain an advantage against any diseases and poisons affecting you, you end any effect
        that stops you from regaining health, and you can restore one ability score back to its original
        score if it had been decreased.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Researching</h2>
    <p>
        You spend your downtime researching a specific subject or topic that you state at the beginning of your research.
        Your DM can decide how long it takes to research the subject. At the end of the researching period, the DM will
        give information relating to your research, ranging from locations to lore to monster statistics.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Running a Business</h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes an adventurer just wants to settle down and run a business for a while.
        These can range from taverns to stores to exotic services. Depending on the amount of days spent running the business,
        you can either gain or lose an amount of gold, but spending more days running a business increases the
        chance of gaining money.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Scribing Spell Scrolls</h2>
    <p>
        In order to make spell scrolls you need the ability to cast spells, time, money, and any material components
        needed for the spell. The time and amount of gold spent depend on the level for the spell; the higher
        the spell level the more it cost to make.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Sowing Rumors</h2>
    <p>
        You can spend your downtime and a little bit of extra money to spread rumors about a specific person or organization.
        The bigger the place, the longer it takes for word to get around. The rumors can range from
        scandalous accusations that will tarnish a reputation to good deeds that will make them seem
        a little bit nicer.
    </p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Training</h2>
    <p>
        First, you need to find a mentor or instructor to teach you how to do the skill.
        After you find your teacher, you can spend a number of days learning the skill, and at the end of the process,
        you'll be proficient in the tool or language.
