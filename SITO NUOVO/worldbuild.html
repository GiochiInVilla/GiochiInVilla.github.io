    <p>
        So, you have recently come into a bit of land, whether it be through money or murder. You can now build a stronghold on it.
        Building a stronghold requires a lot of time and money and usually should be done after a large adventure.
        Basically, the bigger the building is, the more it cost and the longer it takes. Overall, if you have the time and money
        and your party doesn't have a base of operations, a guildhall would probably be the best investment for your party.

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Rooms Bonuses</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Alchemist’s Lab</b><div style="font-size: 12px;">Benefit: All transmutation spells cast within this room by the owners of this structure and their allies have
            twice their normal duration, and half their normal materials cost. In addition, alchemist’s supplies, a
            poisoner’s kit and an herbalism kit are always considered to be present here, and within this room any
            checks with these tools are made with advantage by individuals who have proficiency with them.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>Arcanist’s Study</b><div style="font-size: 12px;"> Choose abjuration, conjuration, enchantment, or illusion. While present within this room, spells in
            the chosen school cast by the owners of this structure and their allies have twice their normal duration,
            and half their normal materials cost. Arcana checks made here that deal with this chosen school of magic
            have advantage. This room may be built multiple times, and each time a different school must be chosen.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>Armory</b><div style="font-size: 12px;">When the structure is under attack, any hireling that is not a spellcaster or soldier and that the
            structure requires for maintenance may visit the armory and afterwards count as a guard.
            Hirelings equipped in this way may also be used offensively rather than simply in defense of the structure.
            Doing so deprives a structure of its hireling staff, however, and removing more
            than a quarter of your structure’s hirelings from its grounds will cause any other benefits the structure
            provides to cease, as the hirelings left behind struggle to cover for those absent.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>Battle Ring</b><div style="font-size: 12px;">Those that spend at least an hour sparring or training here become conditioned for battle, which
            lasts until their next long rest. When a creature that is conditioned for battle rolls initiative, it has
            advantage on the first attack it makes on its first turn in combat.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>Chapel</b><div style="font-size: 12px;"> This room is under the effects of a permanent hallow spell, the details of which are decided upon
            when the construction of this room is completed. Religion checks made here that deal with the lore
            surrounding the deity, philosophy, or religion the chapel is associated with have advantage</div></li><br>
        <li><b>Air Docks</b><div style="font-size: 12px;"> A number of airships equal to your structure’s total room points may moor safely at this room,
            which is likely a spire or free-floating dock. Mechanical elevators and cranes are also present to raise and
            lower cargo.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>Water Docks</b><div style="font-size: 12px;"> A number of ships equal to twice your structure’s total room points may lay anchor safely at this
            room, which is likely a harbor or waterfront.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>Garden</b><div style="font-size: 12px;"> Contains an assortment of herbs and grown vegetables. Every 30 days, the garden provides
            enough ingredients to make either 10 potions of common quality, 4 potions of uncommon quality, or one
            potion of rare quality.
            After the herbs have been picked, the chosen potions must be successfully brewed as a batch
            with an alchemist supplies check. The DC for this check is 10 for common potions, 15 for uncommon
            potions, and 20 for a rare potion. A failure destroys the herbs gathered from this garden until they regrow
            after another 30 days.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>Jails</b><div style="font-size: 12px;"> You have cells available to securely hold a number of humanoids up to five times your
            structure’s total room points. Prisoners may only escape if they are unguarded, and either have access to
            this room’s key (five of which come with this room), or by using thieves’ tools to make four successful DC
            15 Dexterity checks.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>Library</b><div style="font-size: 12px;"> When taking at least an hour to perform an Intelligence or Wisdom check to find specific
            knowledge within this room, you gain advantage on the roll. Even if you do not (or cannot) succeed on
            this roll, you can typically uncover a hint as to where else in the world this information may be found.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>Magical Enchanter</b><div style="font-size: 12px;"> A spellcaster hireling or a character with the Spellcasting or Pact Magic features may use this
            room to make any magic item that is not a potion or artifact. Crafting magic items requires the ability to
            cast at least one spell of a certain level, with higher level spells corresponding to rarer items</div></li><br>

        <li><b>Moat</b><div style="font-size: 12px;">Provides your structure with a roughly circular moat around it, 200 feet wide and 10 feed deep.The moat count as difficult
        terrain, and people not tall enough have to swim to cross it. The moat also have a lowerable drawbridge.</div></li><br>

        <li><b>Poisoner’s Grotto</b><div style="font-size: 12px;"> Every 30 days, this room provides enough ingredients to make a quantity of poison.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>Ritual Circle</b><div style="font-size: 12px;"> Spells may be cast as rituals in half the usual time here without expending any components that
            do not have an associated cost in gold. If a ritual has components with a gold cost, this cost is halved
            when the ritual is performed in this room. While here, the owners of this structure and their allies have
            advantage on all rolls required by rituals.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>Smithy</b><div style="font-size: 12px;">  When you first make this room, choose a specific type of artisan’s tools, such as smith’s tools.
            These tools are always present in this room, and individuals that are proficient with these tools can create
            items in half the normal time while working in this room.
        </div></li><br>
        <li><b>Siege Workshop</b><div style="font-size: 12px;"> A team of at least 10 properly-skilled hirelings can build siege equipment here. The workshop
            may build one of the following options at any one time:<br>
            • Ballista. Takes 15 days, costs 1,000 Eres in materials and labor.<br>
            • Cannon. Takes 15 days (and a knowledge of gunpowder), costs 1,500 Eres in materials and labor.<br>
            • Cauldron, suspended. Takes 15 days, costs 1,000 Eres in materials and labor.<br>
            • Mangonel. Takes 30 days, costs 3,000 Eres in materials and labor.<br>
            • Ram. Takes 15 days, costs 1,000 Eres in materials and labor.<br>
            • Siege Tower. Takes 60 days, costs 5,000 Eres in materials and labor.<br>
            • Trebuchet. Takes 60 days, costs 5,000 Eres in materials and labor.<br>
        </div></li><br>
        <li><b>Stables</b><div style="font-size: 12px;">  Your structure gains the ability to house and support horses or other animals trained to be used
            as mounts, and can hold four of these creatures for each unit of your structure’s maximum room points.
            Mounts that receive a long rest within this room have their movement speed increased by 10 feet until
            their next long rest. This stable does not come equipped with mounts, and mounts must be acquired by
            other means.</div></li><br>
        <li><b>War Room</b><div style="font-size: 12px;"> Soldiers friendly to the owner of this structure may have their journeys (of up to 7 days) planned
            within this room. Doing so effectively doubles the overland speed of these soldiers, causing them to
            complete the planned journey in half the normal time.
            In addition, when a structure that cont
            ains a war room is under attack, all creatures fighting in the
            structure’s defense add 1d4 to their attack rolls to hit.</div></li><br>

    <p>
        Any large-scale structure requires constant work and upkeep to remain operational, and roving heroes
        aren’t usually predisposed to building maintenance. Hirelings are individuals that can perform ordinary or
        skilled tasks at your behest, expecting payment in return. Hirelings of any sort must be paid to retain their services, and hirelings will typically desert their
        service after 7 days without pay.
